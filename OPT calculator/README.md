# opt calculator    
This is a package I used to practice developing an R package    

Examples:   
today()   
*In case you forget the current date*    

daysto("2040-01-01")    
*Calculate days left from 2040-01-01 to today*    

whentoapply("2022-05-01")     
*The earliest and latest date you shall apply for your initial OPT*   

startdate("2022-05-01")   
*The earliest and latest starting date for your OPT, if you graduate in 2022-05-01.*    
*Please refer to your own program for the graduation/completion date*       

useddays("2021-05-01","2021-08-01")     
*If you have used OPT at your current academic level of OPT previously, calculate how many days you have used.*   

enddate("2022-06-01",60)    
*The end date of your OPT, and the date to apply for extension, if applicable.*   
*The example:your OPT start date is 2022-06-01, and you had used 60 days of your OPT previously.*
